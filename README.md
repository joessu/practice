Messed Around with threejs and qt over the weekend.

This project shows an example of using QML and ThreeJS. In this example, I show how you can control content created
with threejs from QML signals, generated from buttons and/or animations.

To run this project, clone it, and open the .pro with qt creator. You need Qt 5.5 to run it.
